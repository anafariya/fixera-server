    body: `<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>Fixera is a marketplace that connects homeowners and businesses with vetted professionals for home services — from plumbing and electrical to solar installations and renovations. We built Fixera to make hiring trades honest, fast, and transparent.</p>

<h2>What we do</h2>
<p>We verify every professional on the platform, standardize quoting and invoicing, hold payments in escrow until work is complete, and back every job with a warranty and dispute process. Customers get reliable pros; professionals get a steady flow of serious work.</p>

<h2>How we work</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Vetted professionals.</strong> Background checks, license verification, and review-gated onboarding.</li>
  <li><strong>Transparent pricing.</strong> Upfront quotes, milestone-based invoicing, no surprise fees.</li>
  <li><strong>Protected payments.</strong> Escrow until milestones are approved — both sides stay safe.</li>
  <li><strong>Real accountability.</strong> Verified reviews, warranty coverage, and a real dispute team.</li>
</ul>
